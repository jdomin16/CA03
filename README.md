# CA03 â€“ Decision Tree Algorithm 
The Assignment CA03 - Decision Tree Algorithms notebook is included in this folder, along with the instructions to follow, the responses to the questions for the assignment in a word file,
and all the data need to follow the notebook.

This assignment will teach you how to construct and implement a decision tree algorithm. The assignment consist of 5 different parts. 
Starting with obtaining the data for the model, you will create visualizations to help you understand the binned census data. You will also need to then split
the test and training data to prepare the data for the model. Then, you will build your model and show a visualization of your decision tree algorithm.
Next, one must determine which set of hyperparameters builds the most accurate model. Which you will end up using those values for a new individual to make a prediction about their income level.
Finally, you will check the probability of the outcome of the prediction and conclude if your prediction is accurate. 

Check the assignment instructions for more information and better understanding.
